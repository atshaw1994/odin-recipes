    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pan-fried scallops with brown butter sauce is a quick and elegant dish perfect for a simple but impressive meal.</p>
    <p>Tender, caramelised scallops are seared to perfection and then drizzled with a rich, nutty brown butter sauce</p>
    <p>infused with garlic and a touch of lemon.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8-10 large scallops</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain all-purpose flour, seasoned with a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Prep the scallops</h4>
            <p>
                First, check your scallops. If they still have the small tough side
                muscle attached (the crescent shape), gently pull it off and discard it.
                Pat the scallops very dry with kitchen paper. This is crucial for getting
                a good sear. Dredge the scallops in the seasoned flour, ensuring they're
                evenly coated. Shake off any excess flour.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Get the pan hot</h4>
            <p>
                Place your frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and the
                small amount of butter. Once the butter is melted and the pan is
                shimmering (but not smoking!), it's ready.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Sear the scallops</h4>
            <p>
                Carefully place the scallops in the hot pan, making sure not to
                overcrowd it (you might need to do this in batches). Leave enough space
                between them so they don't steam rather than fry. Sear for 2-3 minutes
                on each side, until they're a golden-brown colour and slightly
                caramelised. They should be firm to the touch, but still slightly soft in
                the middle.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Rest the Scallops</h4>
            <p>
                Remove the scallops from the pan and place them on the plate lined with
                kitchen paper. This will help absorb any excess oil.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Make the brown butter sauce</h4>
            <p>
                In the same pan (don't wipe it out!), reduce the heat to medium. Add the
                3 tablespoons of butter. Let it melt and continue to cook, swirling the
                pan occasionally, until the butter turns a nutty brown colour and smells
                delicious. Be careful not to burn it! This will take about 2-3 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add flavour</h4>
            <p>
                Take the pan off the heat. Stir in the minced garlic and lemon juice. The
                sauce will bubble up a bit (that's normal). Stir in the chopped parsley.
                Season to taste with salt and pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve</h4>
            <p>
                Arrange the scallops on plates. Spoon the brown butter sauce generously
                over the scallops. Serve immediately with a wedge of lemon and a side of
                your choosing (perhaps some creamy mashed potatoes or a crisp green salad).
