    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A light marinade or glaze is an easy way to liven up an everyday piece of salmon and get your omega- 3s.</p>
    <p>This dish is a subtle, Americanized version of a traditional Japanese teriyaki glaze that uses maple syrup</p>
    <p>as a sweetener, instead of sugar. With a light citrus and maple flavor, this salmon also makes for a festive</p>
    <p>dish at holiday time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
        <li>1 lb salmon fillet</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl whisk the soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic, ginger, and orange zest together.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon fillet in a re-sealable plastic bag and pour in the soy mixture. 
            Close the bag and place onto a plate and store in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
            <strong>(Do not marinate longer than 24 hours.)</strong></li>
        <li>Preheat your broiler. Remove the salmon from the bag and discard the garlic. Place onto a baking
             try and broil for 8 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Serve immediately or at room 
             temperature.</li>
    </ol>
